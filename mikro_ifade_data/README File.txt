Creation of Micro-Expression Image Dataset: 
Micro-expressions are subtle and involuntary facial expressions that reflect the true emotions of an 
individual. Due to the impact areas they are relevant to e.g. psychology, security, and human-computer 
interaction, research of this kind has been somewhat hindered still by a lack of high-quality, detailed 
datasets. There are currently no complete micro-expression datasets on Kaggle or any public repositories. 
Identifying this gap together with the particular needs of the mission led us to the challenge of building 
a new, detailed image dataset dedicated to micro-expressions. This dataset aims to serve as a foundational
resource for researchers and developers, facilitating advancements in the detection, analysis, and 
interpretation of micro-expressions.
